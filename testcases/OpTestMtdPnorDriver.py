OpTestMtdPnorDriver
-------------------

Test MTD PNOR Driver package for OpenPower testing.

.. warning::

   This has been migrated along with other tests but never used in earnest.
   It is likely we could accomplish all of this on the host itself.
   I *severely* doubt this test case currently works as intended.

    This function has following test steps

    1. Get host information(OS and Kernel information)
    2. Load the mtd module based on config value
    3. Check /dev/mtd0 character device file existence on host
    4. Copying the contents of the flash in a file /tmp/pnor
    5. Getting the /tmp/pnor file into local x86 machine using scp utility
    6. Remove existing /tmp/ffs directory and
       Clone latest ffs git repository in local x86 working machine
    7. Compile ffs repository to get fcp utility
    8. Check existence of fcp utility in ffs repository, after compiling
    9. Get the PNOR flash contents on an x86 machine using fcp utility
