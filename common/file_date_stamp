# This simple program will generate the current date time in the following format:
# "yymmdd.hhmmss"
# This is useful in naming files where you would like the date stamp to be part of the file name.  Ex.
# echo hi > name.$(file_date_stamp).status
# You may pass the number of seconds to this program if you wish to format a pre-calculated time.
