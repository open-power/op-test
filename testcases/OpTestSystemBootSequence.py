OpTestSystemBootSequence
------------------------

It will test below system boot sequence operations

Mc cold reset boot sequence.

0) Power off state (and auto reboot policy should be off)
1) Make sure BMC is pinging
2) Issue Cold reset to BMC   =>   ipmitool <...> mc reset cold
3) Ensure BMC stops pinging, wait until BMC fully boots
4) Open network sol console =>                  ipmitool <...> sol activate
5) Power on system   =>   ipmitool <...> chassis power on
6) Make sure boots to Host OS, SOL fine

Mc warm reset boot sequence

0) Power off state (and auto reboot policy should be off)
1) Make sure BMC is pinging
2) Issue warm reset to BMC   =>   ipmitool <...> mc reset warm
3) Ensure BMC stops pinging, wait until BMC fully boots
4) Open network sol console =>                  ipmitool <...> sol activate
5) Power on system   =>   ipmitool <...> chassis power on
6) Make sure boots to Host OS, SOL fine
