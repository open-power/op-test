"""
The OPexpect module is a wrapper around the standard Python pexpect module
that will *always* look for certain error conditions for OpenPOWER machines.

This is to enable op-test test cases to fail *quickly* in the event of errors
such as kernel panics, RCU stalls, machine checks, firmware crashes etc.

In the event of error, the failure_callback function will be called, which
typically will be set up to set the machine state to UNKNOWN, so that when
the next test starts executing, we re-IPL the system to get back to a clean
slate.

When developing test cases, use OPexpect over pexpect. If you *intend* for
certain error conditions to occur, you can catch the exceptions that OPexpect
throws.
