# @package OpTestAt24driver
#  At24(Atmel24) eeprom driver to support openpower platform
#
#  This driver has following functionalities.
#  'at24' is the i2c client driver that interface the EEPROMs on the system.
#   In P8 system, EEPROM devices contain the system VPDs information and this
#   driver is capable of reading and programming the data to these devices.

    #         1. Getting the host infromation(OS and kernel information)
    #         2. Loading the necessary modules to test at24 device driver functionalites
    #            (i2c_dev, i2c_opal and at24)
    #         3. Getting the list of i2c buses and eeprom chip addresses
    #         4. Accessing the registers visible through the i2cbus using i2cdump utility
    #         5. Getting the eeprom device data using hexdump utility in hex + Ascii format
