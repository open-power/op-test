# @package OpTestPrdDaemon
#  PRD daemon for OpenPower testing.
#
#  This class will test the functionality of following.
#  PRD (Processor Runtime Diagnostic) daemon should always be running in HOST OS.
#  For testing out this feature, we require to kill the opal-prd daemon and make sure that the daemon spawns back always.

    #        1. Initially connecting to host console for execution.
    #        2. Check for whether opal-prd daemon is running or not
    #           if it is, get the PID of the opal-prd daemon
    #        3. Kill the opal-prd daemon using its PID
    #        4. Again check if opal-prd daemon spawns back
    #
    # @return BMC_CONST.FW_SUCCESS or raise OpTestError
