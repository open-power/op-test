THE PLAN:

 - assert physical presence
   - clears any existing keys
   - gets the machine in a known state without secureboot
 - enroll a set of PK, KEK, db
   - pregenerated, use secvar sysfs interface
 - reboot, and ensure secure boot is now enabled
 - fail to regular kexec an unsigned kernel
 - fail to load an unsigned kernel
 - fail to load a dbx'd kernel
 - fail to load a signed kernel with unenrolled key
 - successfully load a signed kernel
 - assert physical presence
   - ensure machine is in a non-secure boot state
"""

"""
Generating physicalPresence.bin:
 Create an attribute override file with the following contents (not including leading spaces):

  CLEAR
  target = k0:s0:
  ATTR_BOOT_FLAGS 0x15000000 CONST
  ATTR_PHYS_PRES_FAKE_ASSERT 0x01 CONST
  # ATTR_PHYS_PRES_REQUEST_OPEN_WINDOW 0x01 CONST

 Go to your op-build's <op-build>//build/hostboot-<commit#>/obj/genfiles directory
 From that directory run the following:

  ./attributeOverride -d <path_to_attribute_override_text_file_from_above>

 If it is successful, then an attrOverride.bin file will be created in that directory

"""
Generating oskeys.tar:
 Keys were generated via the makefile in https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/efitools.git.
  NOTE: these tools will currently only build on x86
 Running make generates and assembles a set of openssl keys, ESLs, and signed auth files following the
  commands below.
 Only the auth files are included in the tarball.

 Generating keys (PK example):
  openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj "/CN=PK/" -keyout PK.key -out PK.crt -days 3650 -nodes -sha256

 Generating ESLs (PK example):
  cert-to-efi-sig-list PK.crt PK.esl

 Generating Auths:
  sign-efi-sig-list -k PK.key -c PK.crt PK PK.esl PK.auth
  sign-efi-sig-list -k PK.key -c PK.crt KEK KEK.esl KEK.auth
  sign-efi-sig-list -k KEK.key -c KEK.crt db db.esl db.auth
  sign-efi-sig-list -k KEK.key -c KEK.crt dbx dbx.esl dbx.auth

 NOTE: dbx.esl is currently generated using a soon-to-be-released internal tool, and will be integrated in this test/documentation
 Normally, dbx.esl would be generated with hash-to-efi-sig-list, however that tool has a dependency on PECOFF which
  is not compatible with POWER.
 NOTE: newPK is signed by the PK to test updating the PK, and deletePK is an empty file signed by newPK
  to test the removal of a PK, which exits secure boot enforcement mode.


Generating oskernels.tar:
 kernel-unsigned   - very stripped down kernel built with minimal config options. no signature
 kernel-signed     - same kernel as above, signed with the db present in oskeys.tar
 kernel-unenrolled - same kernel, signed with another generated key that is NOT in oskeys.tar
 kernel-dbx        - same kconfig, but adjusted version name. signed with the same db key. hash present in oskeys.tar's dbx

Signing kernels:
 Kernels are signed with the `sign-file` utility in the linux source tree, like so:
  ./scripts/sign-file sha256 db.key db.crt vmlinuz kernel-signed
