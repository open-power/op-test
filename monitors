# Supported format to run monitors
# command,freqency in seconds,where to run,name of monitor
# Eg:-
# date,2,sut,date-1
#
# 	Above line will create a monitor which runs `date` 
# 	command every 2 seconds inside host using SSH session
# 	and stores in a file which named *date-1*.log
# 	in respective test-reports folder. 
# 
# command:             Any command that is available in the place where it runs.
#
# freqency in seconds: Takes any integer value, `0` is a special value
# 		       where given command itself will run in batch and no
# 		       need to run the command in intervals.
#
# where to run:        Currently supports only in `sut` ie. Host for which
# 		       test is run.
#                      TODO:-
#                      server - runs commands in the server where optest runs.
#		       bmc - runs commands inside bmc.
#
# name of monitor:    Name to be used to represent the monitor
# 		       bydefault, command name is used.
