# @package OpTestAt24driver
#  At24(Atmel24) eeprom driver to support openpower platform
#
#  This driver has following functionalities.
#  'at24' is the i2c client driver that interface the EEPROMs on the system.
#   In P8 system, EEPROM devices contain the system VPDs information and this
#   driver is capable of reading and programming the data to these devices.

    # @brief This i2cdump function takes arguments in pair of a string like "i2cbus address".
    #        i2cbus indicates the number or name of the I2C bus to be scanned. This number should
    #        correspond  to  one  of  the busses listed by i2cdetect -l. address indicates
    #        the address to be scanned on that bus, and is an integer between 0x03 and 0x77
    #        i2cdump is a program to examine registers visible through the I2C bus
    #
    # @param i_args @type string: this is the argument to i2cdump utility
    #                             args are in the form of "i2c-bus-number eeprom-chip-address"
    #                             Ex: "0 0x51","3 0x52" ....etc
